# EchoMunge-Web

Collect text from Wikipedia and other web pages and echo back out text with similar patterns. Pure silliness with no practical purpose. A little like Chinese Whispers but not really.

For Node.js, you'll find EchoMunge-Web in npm as *echomunge-web*.

EchoMunge-Web is built on [EchoMunge](https://github.com/rvagg/node-echomunge), the generic silly-text generator.

### Example

```js
var echoMungeWeb = require('echomunge-web')

echoMungeWeb('http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winston_Churchill', function (err, db) {
  if (err) throw err
  for (var i = 0; i < 100; i++)
    console.log(db.makeText({ maxLength: 500, terminate: true }))
})
```

And you might get something like this:

 > Seemingly staggered by Britain stood again at a ball in Crewe House of differing political backgrounds and Dunkirk.
 >
 > They very much liked tea and was also engaged the army.
 >
 > From Stettin in Britain as France would not support an 85-year-old who served as Prime Minister of Supply.

 >

 > 11 Group's underground bunker at RAF fighter pilots who won, and Adventures.

**OR** you could use the bundled executable that you'll get if you `npm install echomunge-web -g` to do the same thing:

```sh
$ echomunge-web http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winston_Churchill
```

In fact, you can run the commandline tool without any arguments and it'll collect its data from multiple random Wikipedia pages. There are minimum requirements for content so it'll keep on reading new random pages until it gets enough data. This can make for excellent combinations of totally unrelated articles:

 > Rumors that women who claimed to have accepted only three volunteers, artists, widely viewed as the best keyboard Apple ever made.

Or, you can supply just a Wikipedia page name:

```sh
$ echomunge-web "Winston Churchill"
```

**OR** you can just supply a URL of your choice and it'll collect the content from the `<p>` tags:

```sh
$ echomunge-web http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1884724/what-is-node-js
```

Might yield:

 > While the Node server side javascript, it services the next request to be retrieved, there, and the platform, providing one of the page.
 >
 > Because of the equation.
 >
 > JS is here to stay; other languages are targeting it as an event-driven model, you'd order your food and wait in an HTTP based web based business app developer to choose between the other scripting languages are regarding how Node.
 >
 > - great mental weightlifting.
 >
 > node and multi-threading makes one word to describe node, I'd say.
 >
 > ; other language, hardened C-code like Express makes it a lot like javascript to machine code with JS turned on or off with Node, recycle them periodically, Futures, etc.

*Oh what fun!*

## API

```js
echoMungeWeb(url, callback)
```

Your URL can be any of:

 * **`null`** - it'll do its random Wikipedia page(s) thing
 * **Wikipedia page name** - and it'll use that Wikipedia page
 * **Any URL** - and it'll fetch just that page

Your `callback` receives the following arguments:

 * **`error`** - null if all was fine, otherwise an error string or object
 * **`db`** - an [EchoMunge](https://github.com/rvagg/node-echomunge) object filled with data from the collected pages
 * **`urls`** - an array of URLs that data was collected from
 * **`paragraphs`** - the number of useful `<p>` elements found on the page(s)
